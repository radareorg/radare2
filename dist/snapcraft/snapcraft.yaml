summary: Radare2 reverse engineering framework and tool
description: |
  Radare2 (also known as r2) is a complete framework for reverse-engineering
  and analyzing binaries; composed of a set of small utilities
  that can be used together or independently from the command line.
  Built around a disassembler for computer software which generates
  assembly language source code from machine-executable code,
  it supports a variety of executable formats for different processors
  and operating systems.

grade: devel # Development version, can only publish to beta/candidate channels.
confinement: devmode # Unrestricted access, only to beta/candidate channels.

# radare2 requires in most cases privileged access to resources.
# The following "plugs" are thus superfluous because the "devmode" confinement
# gives full access to the system as if it were a DEB/RPM package.
# With the following plugs though, and the "strict" confinement, radare2
# would be able to do things like editing an executable file in the $HOME folder.
