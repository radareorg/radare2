Maps
----

every map has a mapid which is a unique identifier. Code from the outside of RIO shall use this id instead of a pointer. This may cost performance, but pointers can hurt you.

Mapping information in the map:
- from
- to
- delta
- fd

Section Transformation
----------------------
atm there are 3 diffent transformation-targets:
- Hexeditor
- Analysis
- Emulation

Mapping information in the section:
- addr
- size
- vaddr
- vsize
- fd

A section can be related to 2 maps:
- memmap
- filemap

Hexeditor-Transformation:
- check if addr != vaddr, if so continue
- create a map with the size of min (size, vsize), that maps the to fd corresponding desc to vaddr, starting at addr
- filemap is set to the id of the map
- memmap stays 0

Analysis-Transformation:
- when vsize <= size perform Hexeditor-Transformation, and you're done
- create a map with the size of size, that the to fd corresponding vaddr, starting at addr
- filemap is set to the id of the map
- open a new desc, using the null-plugin, with the size of vsize - size
- create another map with the size of vsize - size, that maps the new desc to vaddr + size, starting at 0x0
- memmap is set to the id of the second map

Emulation-Transformation:
- when the section does not allow write-access perform Analysis-Transformation, and you're done
- open a new desc with write-permissions, using the malloc-plugin, with the size of vsize
- copy min (size, vsize) bytes fram the desc, that fd referes to, starting at addr, to the new desc, starting at 0x0
- create a map with the size of vsize, that maps the new desc to vaddr, starting at 0x0
