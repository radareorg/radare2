# Since Java bytecode and Mach-O fat-files have the same magic number, the test
# must be performed in the same "magic" sequence to get both right.  The long
# at offset 4 in a mach-O fat file tells the number of architectures; the short at
# offset 4 in a Java bytecode file is the JVM minor version and the
# short at offset 6 is the JVM major version.  Since there are only
# only 18 labeled Mach-O architectures at current, and the first released
# Java class format was version 43.0, we can safely choose any number
# between 18 and 39 to test the number of architectures against
# (and use as a hack). Let's not use 18, because the Mach-O people
# might add another one or two as time goes by...
