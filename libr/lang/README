Language bindings
=================

Bindings should be generated automatically from vala or C.

The programs running in r_lang should need a better integration with the rest of libs.
This is: We need an api in r_lang to export a C symbol into the language namespace.

For example:

 r_lang_define(lang, "Core", "core", core);
 r_lang_define(lang, "Asm", "asm", asm)

This way the module instances can be shared between the core C application and many
r_lang supported language bindings (perk, python, ..)


TODO
====
r_lang_define is implemented in lang.c, but requires the collaboration
of the plugins to properly setup the environment for the script execution.
