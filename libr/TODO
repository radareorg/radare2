|| search ||
------------
  - bytepat and so should be buggy now, bugfix required
  - implement r_search_xrefs
  - configure before throw the search

|| asm || 
---------
  - Add lua disassembler, dalvik, xtensa achiecture (mm cpu)
  - http://git.linux-xtensa.org/cgi-bin/git.cgi?p=buildroot/buildroot-xtensa;a=blob;f=toolchain/binutils/binutils-xtensa_dc232b.tgz;h=214164399158c540a3033e52b3bb9f65c55289af;hb=HEAD
  - Check if there are endianess issues

|| anal ||  **MISSING**
----------
  - define api, write vapi, integrate in core, etc..
  - integrate with r_var to make variable access analysis

|| bin || 
---------
  - Add mach0
  - Add dex format support (android)

|| cmd ||
---------
  - long commands not yet tested at all
  - added interface to export command list into an autocompletable
    argc, argv for dietline

|| line ||
----------
  - make it work with state like teh rest ???
  - add support for readline callbacks

|| cons ||
----------
  - add pipe_to_buffer..not only file descriptors
  - major cleanup
  - split in multiple files
  - get_real_columns() should be renamed to get_columns()

|| flags ||
-----------
  - Define a way to iterate flags from vala
  - We probably need more methods
  - support to define relations between flags
    (flag hirearchies)
	r_flagtree
	 - r_flags should have a tree construction to access to them faster
	   - btree? following pointers like bigger,smaller
	    { struct r_flag_t *bigger, *smaller; }
	   - hooks r_flag_add to recalculate in r_flag_optimize(), bigger/smaller pointers
	   - hooks r_flag_del to recalculate too.
	 - the r_flag_get by string should have another construction with btree
	   for the string of the name

|| hash ||
----------
  - Extend it with plugins?

|| diff ||
----------
  - Reimplement or fix the delta diffing in C

|| lib ||
---------
  - Cleanup and test w32/osx support
