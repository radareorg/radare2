Compiler pipeline: the picture
------------------------------

 spp     : Simple preprocessor
  |        - includes and conditional compilation
  |
ralang   : The language
  |        - imperative and simple
  |
macros   : architecture independent assembly-like macro-based
  |        - provides calling conventions and syscall definitions
  |
assembly : macros are then converted into assembly
  |        - specific for an OS/arch
  V
gas/rasm2 : assembler compatible with GNU assembler and r2 asm
  |
  V
binary   : the executable, relocatable code
           - inject it for fun and profit


The language
------------

The ralang language aims to be an imperative high-level language providing
limited flexibility with some basic rules for parsing to simplify the
interpretation of the code.

Check t/ for examples

The compiler is a state machine where every character can modify the
internal state of itself while directly producing assembly code.

A gramatical parser is nothing more or nothing less than that. The language
must only permit constructions that can be directly mapped to machine code.

  write($1, .var0, .var4);  

Strings are encoded in the stack at runtime, variable access is done
explicitly by giving the delta offset against the base register.

   .var0 = "Hello";

Access modifiers:

   $1024   = numeric value 
   .var0   = get contents of variable
   &.var0  = get address of variable
   *.var0  = get contents of place where the var points to
