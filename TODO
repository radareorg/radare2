<{include libr/TODO}>

TODO 0.7
========
* Refactor cursor stuff (already done?)imho yes
* w32 is required this?? r2 -d <pid> > dh native > dp=824 > ... -- not really :) for 0.6
* Create radare2-testsuite project
  - tests for ired, rax2, radare2, rabin2 ...
* Record trace of register status for each function when running
  - r_reg_arena_copy();
* Add lua and dalvik disassembler (volunteers?)
* Reimplement or fix the delta diffing in C
  - first we need to do it for ired..
* Trace contents of buffers: filter search results..?  cc 8080 @@ hit* .. check for values that has changed.
* Add dex format support to rabin (android)
* Is RCore->block and blocksize a RBuf ? refactor!11
* add support for sign/unsigned registers..or at least a way to cast them
* Implement rap:// upload/download protocol commands (maybe just system() with rsc2+wget?
* Add support for STATIC_PLUGINS in r_lang
  - r_lang_define is implemented in lang.c, but requires the collaboration
    of the plugins to properly setup the environment for the script execution.
  - Add support for STATIC_PLUGINS in r_lang
  - dlerror(/usr/lib/radare2/lang_perl.so): libperl.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    This issue is fixed by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH...looks like dlopen ignores rpath
* merge asm.arch vm.arch
* Define and use boolean type return type
* Functions in r_util to get lil/big ut8,16,32 from ut8*
* dmi command must read from memory if no file path provided
  - rabin from memory ftw
* rahash takes TOO long to load on big binaries
	[pancake@dazo ~]$ rax -
	jeje
	6a656a650a^C
	[pancake@dazo ~]$ rax2 -
	jeje
	0x0
	^C
* _ZN7WebCore11CounterNode7recountERKNS_12AtomicStringE
  - demangle c++ and objc names
    WebCore.CounterNode.recount(AtomicString)
  _ZN = begin of stream
  0-9+ = count of chars
  E = end of stream
  RKNS_ = start of arguments
* Check if python plugin works from inside (IMHO no)

Questions
=========
* r_list_foreach_prev is buggy, review and remove..
* make symstall in swig/ ?
* What about rsc2 ? deprecate, maintain? cleanup from 1? build? install?
* Add deltified offset in PC? +10, +30 ... asm.reladdr
* Add "pm ?" for bit print like in pb?
* regio not implemented // it is really necessary? imho no..
* Only use uppercase KMG for Kilo,Mega,Giga in r_num? - 'g' is for double
* distribute 'spp' with 'rarc2' ? imho no

Debugger
========
* stepover waits for one unknown event that cannot be stopped
* Implement DRX support
* Implement list threads on ALL supported platforms (win,lin,osx)
* ALL threads must be stopped when a breakpoint is handled..
* Floating point registers
* MMX/XMM/DRX control
* Implement dump+restore as macros (dump,)

TODO nibble
-----------
* r_anal
  - use r_anal_value everywhere
  - x86im
    - make x86_x86im the default backend for x86 analysis
* diff code analysis
  - diff two programs
     1st level:
        - check all functions EQUAL, DIFFERENT, REMOVED, ADDED
        - check all symbols
        - check all imports
        - check all strings
     2nd level:
        - basic block level diffing (output in graph mode)
* GMP
  - big-ssl.c big-gmp.c ...
  - implement GMP in util/big.c
    - http://etutorials.org/Programming/secure+programming/Chapter+7.+Public+Key+Cryptography/7.5+Generating+a+Prime+Number+Testing+for+Primality/

TODO edu
--------
* remove all uses of alloca()
* Implement more get_main()
* typedef all function pointers, like in r_bp
* Implement /A : search AES
* Implement case-insensitive search (e search.casematters ?) any better name? Use /i?
* Implement /. to search using a file .. isnt zignatures about this?
* Implement /p to search for patterns
  - implement it in r_core ?? or add r_io_bind support
* Implement search and replace /s

TODO pancake
------------
* rarc2 allows to compile invalid code like calling puts() out of context
* Implement RAnalCall (analyze function arguments, return values, propagate types..)
  - define number of arguments for given function
  - warn if signature and analysis differs in number of args or so..
  - when calling a function
    - identify arguments passed and compare with arguments required
    - if they do not match: we need to warn/ask user/store multiple options
       - function signature comparsion if they dont match
       r_anal_fcn_cmp (anal, f1, f2);

Bindings
========
* generate accessors from valaswig
* Script plugins
 - We should enable r_lib to implement plugins in any
   scripting language, so we can for example prepare
   a .c stub interface for python/perl/ruby/..
   - this requires a swig bridge

Refactoring
===========
* Import r_vm register values from flags or from r_debug->r_reg
  - r_vm must use mmu cache when emulating code
    - use the one from r_io? and deprecate vm->mmu_cache?
* Review the r_flags api
* Add pipe_to_buffer..not only file descriptors
* r_config set_int and so..simplify
  - find/use more common cases for char* or &int maps
    - automatic callbacks for most common usecases
* What do we have to do with r_th, r_vm ?
* Merge r_vm into r_anal ?
* Merge r_socket inside r_util ?
* Add SSL support to r_socket ?
* Discuss missing r_core_sysenv_update in core/file.c:33
* Add RLog API.. pipeable to disk and stderr..also hookable ..cool for ui (partially done)
* Move disasm loop into r_print (r_print should depend on r_asm)
  - thats hard :)
* Move 'r_syscall_t' stuff into r_debug (sync r_core)
* Implement r_bind api to link multiple pointers
  core->asm = r_bind_set (core->asm->bind, r_asm_new ());
* Find a better name for r_buf_fread (really?)
* Review r_io and r_reg API
* semi-ok state (R_TRUFAE), implement r_errno and r_errstr in r_util?
  - useful in r_sys_mkdir ?
* Finish and import the spp's getopt owns implementation in r_util (like in p9)

 
Future
======
* Implement minimalist 'ar' and add support for .a archive libs? (not necessary in this life)
* Realign flags when using project in debug mode
* FileDescriptors: dd -- copy from !fd in r1
* Initial analysis looking for xrefs to strings and so? ax? ./a@@entry0 - Launched at startup
* Store version information in libraries ? debian claims for it
* install.sh (to track installed files ..)
* acr -ldl check must be fixed for kfreebsd
* Add support for float/double in r_num :?
* radare2 -e dbg.engine=vm -d ls
  - load the program using r_bin in virtual space
  - initialize vm and set regs
  - debug backend should use the vm

Flags
=====
  - metaflags? support to define relations between flags
    (flag hirearchies)
	r_flagtree
	 - r_flags should have a tree construction to access to them faster
	   - btree? following pointers like bigger,smaller
	    { struct r_flag_t *bigger, *smaller; }
	   - hooks r_flag_add to recalculate in r_flag_optimize(), bigger/smaller pointers
	   - hooks r_flag_del to recalculate too.
	 - the r_flag_get by string should have another construction with btree
	   for the string of the name

Transaction notes
=================
Loading big binaries results on broken interaction.
  - Optimize bottlenecks
    - Index flags by name and offset
    - Dont walk all the entries all the time
    - Use RDB or RHashMap
  - Cache
    - We can just cache the last N used pointers to resolve them faster
    - Should work fine for disassembling and others
  - Transactions and threads
    - BIGLOCK is enought i think
    - A background thread can load rabin info
    - r_th is required
    - We need a way to get 'status' info from thread (msg passing?)
      - r_th_msg
    - We can lock the loading thread when a shell command is going to be executed
